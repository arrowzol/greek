vowels:
    diphthongs (meaning "double sound") [ch 1]:
        DLB: vowel pairs that end in ι or υ and don't repeat
        considered "long"
        sound made by two vowels placed together
        Greeks didn't want to make 2 sounds, just one
        ending with ι:
            ᾰι  - [ai]sle
            ᾱι  - m[a]ll ??, written ᾳ
            ει  - w[ai]t
            ηι  - w[ai]t ??, written ῃ
            οι  - [oi]l
            ωι  - "oh" ??, written ῳ
            υι  - q[uee]n [whee]l

        ending with υ:
            ᾰυ  - c[ow]
            ευ  - f[eu]d
            ου  - b[oo]t

consonants:
    categories:
        Labials - formed with the lips
        Dentals - formed with the tongue and teeth
        Palatals - formed with the tongue and palate

        Stops (unvoiced) - must momentarily stop the airflow
        Voiced stops - stop and vibrate (voice) vocal cords
        Aspirated - add a "breathing" sound, like wind
        Nasal - air through the nasal cavity
            γγ - fu[n]gus
        liQuid - tongue parially blocks airflow

    sigma:
        σ - [s]igma

        (π β φ) + σ = ψ

    zeta:
        ζ originally represending σδ or δσ

breathing marks [ch 3.I]:
    marks:
        rough: ἁ (looks like begin single quote) - add "h" sound to beginning of the word
        smooth: ἀ (looks like begin end quote) - not rough
    goes on vowels at the beginning of words
        mark the second vowel of diphthongs
    rules:
        ρ always has a rough mark

accent marks:
    syllables:
        ultima: last
        penult: 2nd last
        antepenult: 3rd last
    marks:
        acute: ά (looks like /) - rise in pitch
            goes on all short vowels [ch 3.II.1]
            can go on long vowels, see conversion tables above
        grave: ὰ (looks like \) - fall/absence of pitch
            on the ultima if the word being accented is both:
                (1) followed by another word
                (2) has an accute accent on the ultima
        circumflex: ᾶ (looks like ~) - rise and fall in pitch
            άὰ = ᾶ
            ίὶ = ῖ
            ύὺ = ῦ
            έὲ = ῆ
            όὸ = ῶ
    goes on the vowels of any of the last three syllables
        short vowels get the acute mark

elision [3.Elision and Movable Nu.I]

movable nu [3.Elision and Movable Nu.II]
    a word inding in σι followed by a word beginning with a vowel or dipthong "often" does not elide, so a ν is added
